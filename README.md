# 2D Shooting Game

A simple and fun 2D Shooting Game developed in C using the `graphics.h` library (Turbo C++).

The player controls a shooter at the bottom of the screen, firing bullets to hit a moving target.  
Miss 10 shots and the game is over!

## Features
- 🎯 Moving target across the top of the screen
- 🚀 Player movement (left/right) and bullet shooting
- 🎮 Score tracking and missed shot counter
- ❌ Game Over after 10 missed shots
- 🖥️ Built with C and `graphics.h` (Turbo C++)

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Turbo C++** or **an environment that supports `graphics.h`** installed.
   
2. Set up the BGI graphics path correctly. In this code, it's set to:
"C:\TURBOC3\BGI"
Adjust it if needed based on your system.

3. Compile and run the code:
- If using Turbo C++:
  - Create a new project.
  - Add the `.c` file.
  - Set the graphics library.
  - Compile and run.
